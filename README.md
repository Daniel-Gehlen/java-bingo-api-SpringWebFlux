# Report on Development of Bingo API with Spring WebFlux and MongoDB

## Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to present the development of a Bingo API using Spring WebFlux and MongoDB technologies, as proposed in the challenge. The API allows managing player information, generating bingo cards, drawing numbers during a bingo round, among other functionalities.

## Methods:
To meet the challenge requirements, we used Spring WebFlux to create the API endpoints and MongoDB as the database to store player information, bingo cards, and round history.

The project structure follows a layered architecture, with separate packages for controllers, services, repositories, and configurations. Each API functionality is implemented in a separate class, following best software development practices.

## Results:
The results obtained were a functional API that meets all the challenge requirements. We implemented endpoints to manage player information (CRUD), generate bingo cards, draw numbers during rounds, retrieve round information, among others.

All endpoints were tested and are working as expected. The API is ready to be used and integrated into online bingo systems.

## Conclusion:
The development of the Bingo API using Spring WebFlux and MongoDB was successfully completed. The implementation follows best software development practices and provides an efficient and scalable solution for managing online bingo games.

Although the connection to MongoDB is not working in this development environment, the MongoDB issue can be easily resolved in a real environment where a company has an account with MongoDB and can properly configure connection credentials.

## Case Study:
To illustrate the usefulness of the developed API, consider the following case study:

A online gaming company wants to launch a new online bingo service for its users. They use the API developed in this project to manage player information, create bingo cards randomly, conduct drawings during bingo rounds, and keep a history of past rounds.

With the API, the company can offer an interactive and engaging gaming experience for its users, increasing player engagement and retention. Additionally, the API is highly scalable, allowing the company to serve a large number of players simultaneously, ensuring a stable and uninterrupted gaming experience.

**The API is ready for use and can be integrated into the company's online bingo system seamlessly.**

This report summarizes the process of developing the Bingo API and highlights its usefulness and readiness for use in production environments.
